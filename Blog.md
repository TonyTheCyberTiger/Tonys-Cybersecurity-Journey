My journey from Navy Intel to Cybersecurity
# From Navy Intel to Cybersecurity: Why I’m Making the Jump

After serving 7 years in the U.S. Navy as an Intelligence Specialist—and with 4 years left until I transition out in April 2029—I’ve decided to take a different path after military life: cybersecurity.

Originally, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Criminal Justice from Liberty University with the idea that I might pursue law enforcement after the Navy. But over time, that path didn’t feel like the right fit. I also considered becoming a naval officer, but that didn’t align with my long-term goals either.

What has consistently captured my interest, though, is **cyberwarfare**.

While serving at INDOPACOM JIOC in Hawaii, I studied Chinese military strategy extensively. It became clear that any potential conflict involving Taiwan will almost certainly include a significant cyber component. That realization sparked something in me—I want to be part of the future fight, not just as an analyst but as a defender in the cyber domain.

Right now, I’m still exploring which area of cybersecurity best suits me. But based on my intelligence background, I feel naturally drawn toward becoming a **Cyber Threat Analyst**. The skills I’ve developed—collecting, analyzing, and interpreting adversarial behavior—translate directly into threat intelligence work.

To prepare for the career shift, I’ve re-enrolled at Liberty University (the same school where I got my first degree), and I’m working toward a **Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity**. I’ve got about 50 credits left to go.

I’ve also started the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** to build my foundational skills. I’m currently on module 3 out of 8, and the course has already given me hands-on experience in areas like security audits and risk assessments.

Much of my early understanding of how to break into the field has come from **Simply Cyber**, a fantastic online community and resource hub. One of the best pieces of advice I got from them was to **start a blog**. It’s a way to:
- Track my progress
- Document my learning
- Showcase my growth to future employers

So here I am—starting this blog to share everything I learn along the way. If you’re also transitioning from the military or curious about cybersecurity, I hope you’ll follow along and learn with me.

Let the journey begin.
